\begin{cvletter}

\lettersection{Introduction}
My name is Yii Kuo Chong, a final year systems engineering student at Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman and I'm writing to express my interest in joining Hennge's Global Internship Program (Batch 6 2024).

\lettersection{Why Hennge}
I want to find a diverse, and international environment where I can actually learn a lot. To make my internship worth it so to say, and Hennge fits the bill very well.

Through reading the company's blog, I'm impressed at how seriously the company takes it's internship program. It seems that from a couple accounts, interns are require to undergo a training course where they have to build and deploy a fullstack application. 

I believe I can learn a lot from this. In particular, I'm interested in how software is managed and developed, how the technologies is used, and I'm looking to learn some devops knowledge as I never really had the chance to dabble in devops professionally.

\lettersection{Why me?}
I am a professional software developer with experience building scaleable frontend/backend applications in NodeJS/Python for 3 years. Before that, I dabbled in programming since 2016 as a hobbyist. Ocassionally, I work on personal projects, and accept contract work.

In 2021, I decided to pursue a degree in Information Systems Engineering, where I have consistently maintained a 3.0 CGPA since my education began. Not only that, I've developed a fullstack IOT Debugging tool to assist my professor in his research project.

Currently, I'm aiming to gain experience working overseas so I am interested in continue working with Hennge after my internship.

\lettersection{Conclusion}
All in all, I would love to intern at Hennge. Please feel free to reach out to me through email if you have any questions about my qualifications. Thank you for reading my letter. I look forward to hearing from you.
