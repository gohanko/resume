      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
        \item {Contracted to build the backend for an invoice management system by a software house for their client.}
        \item {In summary, it is a basic CRUD app built using Django, complete with unit tests and documentation.}
        \item {There were about 16 views/pages which does various stuff but essentially boils down to CRUD.}
        \item {Business logic is written primarily in these views, and models are kept strictly for data queries and data manipulation.}
        \item {Tests are written using unittests which tests the views by checking its return values (status code, content in page, etc), tests are also written for models to check if our custom functions are returning the correct values.}
        \item {Deployed on an Ubuntu instance (Debian is also tested). This involved a lot of manual setup but in hindsight we could have use Docker and written scripts to automate the deployment as well as data backups. CI/CD would have been nice as well.}
