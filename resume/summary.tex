Started my software journey with freelancing, building landing pages and backend APIs (Python/Django). Eventually found a job as a software developer working on a real-time trading application with 2.5M+ users, and \$650B+ monthly volume (React apps and Perl5 microservices). 

Decided to go back to university, and started my own consultancy business while managing my responsibilities as a full time student where I completed 5 front-end, and back-end projects from companies all around the world. All in all 6 years of software development experience.
