I started my career in 2017 with freelancing; building landing pages, and backend APIs. Then in 2018, I got hired as a software developer at a options trading company called Deriv Services Sdn. Bhd. doing both frontend and backend work. 

That is until 2021, where I decided to enroll in university, and started freelancing again while managing my responsibilities as a full time student. I graduated in 2025 with a Bachelor of Information Systems (Honours) Information Systems Engineering from University Tunku Abdul Rahman.
